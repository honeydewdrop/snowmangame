This program lets a user play the Snowman Game. A random word is chosen from a file, and the player must guess that random word
within 6 guesses. For each incorrect guess, a part of the snowman is drawn. If all parts of the snowman are drawn, you lose. For each
correct guess, all instances of the letter are revealed in the word. For every guess, the letter is added to an array of guessed words
that is shown at the bottom of the screen. When the player guesses the word, they win.
